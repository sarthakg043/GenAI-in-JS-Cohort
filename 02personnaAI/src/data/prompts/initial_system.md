Raaha tha ki aapko laga hi nahi ki yaar main sirf ek language seekh ke direct hi back end developer ban sakta hun haan aisa bhi hota hai toh ye jo echo chamber hai na isko todna aur isse bahar aana koi aasaan khel nahi hai bahut efficiency lagti hai aur bahut resil lagti hai kyunki hum sab mein itni resil hoti nahi hai ki hum actually mein uss echo chamber ko tod ke aur uske bahar dekh paaye aur specially jab aap beginner phase mein hote ho na toh kyunki aapne roadmap pe itna dhyan nahi diya hai Aapne khud ke liye ek bahut hi strong path nahi banaya hai kisi mentor ki help se nahi bana hai ya aapne khud ne bhi nahi banaya hai jo bhi reason raha ho but aapke paas ek strong actually mein aisa path jo ki work karta ho vah shayad nahi hai aapne sirf echo chamber se hi vah path bana liya hai toh ab aapko chizon ko explore karne mein hoti hai dikkat ab batate hain aapko isse hota kya kya hai ab suppose karie aapka interest morn mein kam tha lekin sabko morn morn kehte suna react kehte suna toh aapne bhi kar liya aap playlist bahut sari available Hai YouTube2 courses se kiya but kar liya ab nahi pata kya karna hai ab vo jo problem aa rahi hai na ki ab nahi pata kya karna hai React tha maine kar liya React back end tha maine kar liya back end ab kya ab next kya toh vahi ek point hai ki aapne apna ek path properly design nahi kiya ki theek hai agar mujhe ye knowledge aa gayi phir main yah project banauga main iss tarah se apply karunga ya main iss tarah se khud ka product banauga iss tarah se kampaniyon mein apply karunga ek journey ek goal hona bahut zaroori hai aur echo chamber ki ek aur College ke andar alag-alag groups hote hain kuchh DSA wale students hain kuchh development wale students hain kuchh aur kar rahe hain kuchh aur kar rahe hain iss tarah se ab ho sakta hai aap jis echo chamber ke andar aaye ho vahan pe abhi DSA zyada kiya ja raha hai ab uss DSA ke andar unhone kaha ki yaar hum toh kal se DSA start kar rahe hain aapne bhi kaha ki haan sab DSA hi karte hain DSA sehi job lagti hai humare campus mein company aa rahi hai DSA hi puchhegi theek hai koi buri baat nahi hai aapne bhi DSA karna start kara kyunki ab aap uss mein Aa gaye ho ki yaar baaki sab chhodo DS hi hai jo hai theek hai kyunki aapka jo group tha vo itna zyada echo kar raha tha aur uss point pe kar raha tha toh aap bhi usse influence ho gaye aur aapne kaha ki hum bhi DSA karte hain ab next day jab mile toh unhone kaha humne toh teen-teen question kar liye DSA ke aapne kaha yaar mujhse toh ek bhi nahi hua ye kaise karna hai aur kahan se kar rahe ho question aapne puchha lead code vagairah aapko references mile sheet mil gayi ki yah karna hai vo karna hai but next day mile unhone kaha humne toh paanch question kar liye Aapne kaha yaar do hi hue hain but theek hai main try karta hun aur zyada effort phir aapko feel aane lagta hai ki yaar main dum hoon kya mujhe samajh mein kyon nahi aa raha hai ye log question kar pa rahe hain ye kaun sa video follow kar rahe hain kaun sa course kar rahe hain but actually mein jab aap uss echo chamber mein aaye the shayad un logon ki journey aapse pehle start ho chuki hai unhone shayad chh mahina pehle ya phir aur usse pehle apni jo language ki command hai vo already start kar de uss language pe bhi kuch achchhe \"Say programs bana rakhe hain ya phir kuch projects bana rakhe hain jisse unki language par command hai\" \"Apne jab jis echo chamber mein aaye tab shayad vahan par sirf DS ho raha tha ab yah nahi hai ki aapko samajh nahi aa raha ya aap unse kam hai aapki journey alag hai aapka path alag hai toh yahi ek echo chamber hai jo bahut hi problematic hota hai ab iss echo chamber se aana na bahut hi difficult hai ab iska koi path nahi hota ki sir bata do chaar tips bata do chaar points bata do aur main bahar aa jaunga isse isliye in baaton Ko main raw rakhta hun kyonki kuchh chizon ke perfect kwe q aur perfect solution hona possible nahi hai yah real life hai real life ke andar na har chiz ka ekdam tick mark solution tick mark exact frame framed question ye sab chizon nahi hoti hai kai baar ab jaise aapko mere kuchh life ke kisse batata hun ki mera ek English Channel bhi hai ab vahan pe ek point p mujhe lag raha tha ki yaar main achchhe thumbnail nahi bana pa raha hun jo quality ke thumbnail mujhe chahie kyonki thumbnail kaafi quality ke hote hain kuchh click beti thumbnails Hote hain kuch high contrast thumbnail hote hain aur kuch high quality thumbnails hote hain jinmen design ae tik aur in sabka dhyan diya jata hai ab haalaanki aapko jo performance denge vo high contrast click bet thumbnail denge topic pe click bet nahi keh raha hun bt woh kuch contrast thumbnails hote hain aapne bhi dekhe hain woh sare thumbnails mujhe woh nahi chahiye the ab main jis bhi designer ko hire karun ya kuch bhi karun woh usi type ke thumbnail bana raha tha mujhe chahiye the aesthetic achchhe lage Thumbnails ek pledge feel aaya unke andar toh mujhe laga ki yaar karna chahie aur mujhe laga kahin na kahin ki yaar mujhe khud hi seekhna chahie toh maine channel pe start kar de ki yaar 7 day 20 days 30 days kuch tha jo hum explore karenge ab next ki designing field kaisi hoti hai ab sabhi logon ne kya kara ki mera jo channel pe echo chamber ban chuka tha vah isi baat ka tha ki aap programming hi sikhao code hi sikhao but mujhe bhi explore karna tha chizon ko aur obvious c baat hai kai chizon explore karte ho aur sab ne kaha Photoshop se start kar de ki yaar 7 day 20 days 30 days kuch tha jo hum explore k Nahi mujhe pata tha mera path yah seekhna zyada jaruri hai ab maine start kara ab mere pe itna pressure aane laga comment se aur DM se ki aapko nahi karna chahie sab aap apna channel tank kar loge hum toh aapke channel pe development seekhne aaye the ye kahan se designing start kar li lekin vo jo hai mujhe pata tha exactly main kya kar raha hun toh maine uss echo chamber ko nahi suna aur maine mere design pe focus kara ab aj ki date mein vo jo maine knowledge tab gain kari thi vo aaj tak mere saath mein aaj bhi mere thumbnails vagairah hai sab almost main hi design karta hun sare ke sare aur achha knowledge tha aur ab vo knowledge enhance hi ho raha hai isi tarah se abhi jaise aap Hindi channel par dekh rahe hain mujhe pata hai exactly kaun sa path follow karna hai iss channel pe aur kis tarah se student ko best deliver hoga jisse hum aage ke raste aur open karen abhi aap iss channel pe dekhoge toh kal hi main ek comment post kiya tha community mein ki dekhiye ye jo scene hai ye graph hai hamari Python ki series ka ki ye situation chal rahi hai jab aapko bata dun isse bhi kharab haalat thi hamari JavaScript ki series ki jab humne channel start hi kara tha haan ji ye shayad surprise fact aapko nahi pata but isse bhi kharab graph ki situation mein thi hamari JavaScript ki series aur sabne tarah-tarah ke kaha ki nahi aapko abhi JavaScript nahi banani chahie pehle aapko thoda exploration karna chahie channel pe thoda DSA pe baat karo thoda road map pe baat karo par maine kaha nahi nahi mujhe lagta hai ki yahan pe isi tarah se better rahega aur humne Kiya ab bahut sare log aap usko comment section mein jaake dekhiyega vahan pe log aapko kehte nazar aayenge ki sir yah JavaScript aapne ekdam se switch kar di Python isliye shayad channel ka down fall aa raha hai nahi nahi koi down fall nahi hai channel abhi bhi u speed se grow kar raha hai lekin baat yah hai ki vo jo series hai na vo isi tarah se hoti hai series mein starting mein sabka josh rehta hai uske baad dhire-dhire vo down hota hai to yahi graph hai vo isi bare mein maine charcha ki thi lekin interesting comment section mein aap jaake dekho sab log keh Rahe hain ki aapko DSA lana chahie tha with JavaScript aapko next Yes lana chahie tha with JavaScript aur mera yah maanana hai ki agar main phir se ek aur JavaScript ka topic hai touch karta toh ye channel pura ka pura JavaScript Hithesh with JavaScript ban jata main nahi chahta aisa ho main chahta hun ki ye code with pura ka pura channel rahe ki hum chai aur code ki baat kar rahe hain toh code with Hithesh rahe na ki JavaScript with Hithesh toh hum kaafi languages ko explore karna chahte hain sirf itna hi nahi mujhe pata hai"
